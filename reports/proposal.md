# Vinny
*March 31, 2019*

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create **Vinny**: a command-line text editor in C that clones some of vim's basic features. At a lower bound, she will have the following features: up/down/left/right motions, toggle between normal, insert and command line modes, and character deletion (better for your pinky!), and saving to disk. This should be very reasonable to accomplish given the time-line of our project and our current competencies/resources. At an upper bound, we hope to further upgrade her skills so she can also understand more complex motions like multipliers, word motions, delete <motion>, change <motion>, string search, and any number of other vim-like behaviors.

## Learning Goals
Ilya is interested in getting an introduction to vim. We also see this as an excellent project to put the concepts we've been learning about this year into practice. Creating a text editor will require careful memory management, file read/write, command line arguments, objects, and a carefully constructed architecture.

## Needed resources
We intentionally chose this project because we feel confident we can jump in and use it as a test of the knowledge we've gained in this class. Unlike Cynthesis (our previous project) we do not anticipate working with any frameworks or new external libraries.

## First steps

Here are the basic steps to lay out the framework for this project:
- Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository and add Ilya. (Duncan)
- Step 2: Create a new Trello taskboard and add Ilya. (Duncan)
- Step 3: Load a text file and print to screen. (Ilya)

We will further divide these tasks when we were deeper into the project:
- Step 4: Incorporate printing of line number.
- Step 5: Reprint the screen to update for changes.
- Step 6: Show where the cursor is in the file.
