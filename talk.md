# Vinny final talk

## Meet Vinny

This is Vinny, a command-line text editor in C
that clones some of vim's basic features.

The core structure of a text editor was the primary goal for the project.

Vinny allows
    switching of modes,
    navigation of a cursor,
    an insertion of characters,
    and a command mode for saving and quitting,
    all with a basic view displaying lines, line numbers, mode, and cursor position.

## crash course: model view controller



## challenges

    - C SUX
    - memory allocation & seg faults
    - "taking out the trash" stack frame weirdness
    - architecture supports development
